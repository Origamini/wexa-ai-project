Creating the sample nextjs app with the following command

`npx create-next-js wexa-ai-project`

choose the default options and then the sample next js app is created.

later on create a Dockerfile and upload the project in the github 

we need to create a classic token with the write  permission in the we will use GHCR to upload the images which will be build by the dockerfile.

we will use workflows the yaml file to control the automation task.

then we will launch and ec2 instance and install docker, minikube.

we will create secrets with the kuberetes command and use it while deploying the app with the deployment.yaml file and the service.yaml.

## Please note that I will still writing the readme file to explain my project I would require somemore time till 24 to 48 hours. thank you.
